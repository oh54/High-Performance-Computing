\subsection{Nat}

The Sun Studio compiler is used, and therefore the driver required is matmult\_c.studio.


First, the goal is to write a native function, which performs a matrix-matrix multiplication. The shape has to be suitable for the operation, but it is arbitrary within the limits. Regarding matrix indexing, we use the double pointer representation A[i][j]. \\
The general function prototype used is displayed below:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption=Function Prototype]
void matmult_NNN(int m, int n, int k, double ** A, double ** B, double ** C)
\end{lstlisting}

The function prototypes are all declared in the header file ass1\_lib.h. The functions themselves are described in the ass1\_lib.cpp file, where the ass1\_lib.h library is included. \\

The native function takes the integer arguments m, n and k, as well as the double arguments **A, **B and **C. The double arguments are the actual matrices, which in the case of matrix A and B are generated within the supplied driver based on the submitted shape parameters. In the case of C, only the memory is allocated. To perform the matrix-matrix multiplication a for loop for each of the 3 shape parameters is required. Three loop variables i, j and l are introduced for the matrix leading dimensions m, n and k. The C matrix has the leading dimensions of m and n, C[i][j]. The function is displayed below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption=Function Prototype]
void matmult_nat(int m, int n, int k, double ** A, double ** B, double ** C){
	for(int i = 0; i < m;i++){
		for(int j = 0; j < n;j++){
			C[i][j] = 0;
			for(int l = 0; l < k;l++){
				C[i][j] += A[i][l]*B[l][j];
			}
		}
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

Notice the += sign, which is caused by the fact, that when the function loops over l, the multiplications for the different values of l are added to the
