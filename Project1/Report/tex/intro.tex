The goal of this assignment is to develop different matrix-matrix multiplication functions and to analyze and compare their performance.

\subsection{Computing Specifications}
Unless otherwise stated a lot of the specifications are fixed throughout the report. The code is written in c++ and compiled with the Sun Studio compiler. We therefore use the matmult\_c.studio driver. All the experiments are run on the hpcintro cluster on a single node with one processors per node (ppn), which is specified in the submit.sh script. All the nodes on the cluster are identical. The makefile used is the supplied sunCC makefile with CXX = sunCC for c++ modified for the different cases.
